## The problem with duplicate CV submissions

We all hate it when two recruiters claim to "own" the same candidate.

This is often known as duplicate CV submission.

This is bad for everyone:

* Hiring managers and HR trying to get a candidate in are stuck in the middle of warring recruiters, both claiming a fee, even if one of the recruiters was given permission to operarte or is on a preferred supplier list (PSL).
* Recruiters stand to lose their best candidate and have a relationship with a client tainted, ruining a deal they've worked hard to make happen.
* Candidates have lost the opportunity of a lifetime through no fault of their own because a shady recruiter has snuck an extra copy of their CV in and the employer wants nothing to do with a recruiter-war.

Currently the solution seems to be to send an email to the candidate saying "please fill in this....

> "I [candidate name]  
> agree to be represented by [recruiter company]  
> for the role at [end client]"  

This is hardly bullet-proof.

We can do better.

Let's fix this.

## What brought you here?

* [I'm an external recruiter](recruiter/)
* [I'm a job hunter / contractor](candidate/)
* [I'm a hiring manger / internal recruiter](hiring/)
