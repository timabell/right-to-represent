## The problem with duplicate CV submissions

Duplicate submissions add painful costs to the tech industry:

* Candidates and contractors are losing great opportunities
* Recruitment firms are losing commissions and getting into legal wrangling with clients and competitors
* Employers and end-clients are losing perfect candidates that can't be hired because of conflicts

Let's fix this.

## What brought you here?

Let's talk about you.

* [I'm an external recruiter](recruiter/)
* [I'm a job hunter / contractor](candidate/)
* [I'm a hiring manger / internal recruiter](hiring/)

## What stage is this at?

So far I've identified there's an annoying problem in the market, I have an idea how it might be fixed, but I'm holding off building anything until I've had a chance to talk to people about there experiences and validate that this it's a problem worth fixing. If you want to see this improved then please do get involved in the early research. People who helped out early will not be forgotten, besides it's always nice to build some new relationships.
